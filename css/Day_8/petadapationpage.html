            <p>
                Jerry will make you laugh.
                He'll sit very still with his head cocked, move tentatively toward you,
                then burst into an adorable wiggly walk with his ears sticking straight up.
                Jerry is clearly a special dog,
                a sweetheart that we're hoping will find people who appreciate a more sensitive nature.

                The cartoon character Tom Cat is a grey and white tuxedo cat who is one of the main characters in
                the Tom and Jerry animated short film series.
                Tom is known for his superhuman elasticity, and is usually defeated by Jerry Mouse, the other main character.
